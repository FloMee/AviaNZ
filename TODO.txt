   How to get a moving pointer working?!
 
1. Interface for Kim.
    -> user manual
    -> extra points she wanted

2. Finish median clipping segmentation (and also thresholded power and amplitude).

3. Finish the Raven feature selection.

4. Finish the wavelet segmentation.

5. 100% confidence on existence and non-existence of (e.g.,) kiwi. Show those not sure about.

-----

5. Testing of the interface, finishing the denoising, segmentation.

6. Cross correlation and related.

7. Some learning.

8. Some code in C?

9. What needs tidying in the code?

Some ideas about things that would be nice:
    User picks a segment, algorithm to find similar ones and show just those (or copy label)
    Would it be good to have a 'confirmed' button so that algorithm knows it is correct? Or just assume?
        So after processing a file, you either run through it, or you get shown each one in it's own window (or a column of them)
        Could then click on those that are wrong
    Some database storage stuff and meta information about the sound files?

Button for multitapering on/off
Tidy up the naming for the interface elements
Mini method for text resizing
Make choice of context menu or list of birds
